# wtf_service
42 administration project.
You create your own kubernetes network that is working in virtual machine with your own Dcoker images, YAML files and config files for every service used.
There's Wordpress site working in NGINX-driven server, MariaDB database and Phpmyadmin to manage it.
Also there's Grafana service, collecting metrics from every container and showing CPU and memory load from every of them.
As a bonus, there's made a ftps server.
Every container is based on Alpine Linux, the most minimalistic Linux distribution so you got to figure out a way to make things work that are usually built-in any vanilla Linux.
